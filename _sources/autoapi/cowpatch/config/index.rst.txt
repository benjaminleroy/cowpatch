.. py:data:: rcParams
   

   underlying parameters of that control the generation of the actual
   images

   maxIter : int
       maximum number of iterations to be used to convert
       a plotnine ggplot object output into the correct size
   min_size_px : int
       early stopping rule for conversion a plotnine ggplot
       object output into the correct size, if size of image
       goes below this value the process stops with an error
   eps : float
       difference between desired and converged sizes to successfully
       stop the interation for the conversion a plotnine ggplot
       object output into the correct size
   save_verbose : boolean
       logic if saving a cow.patch arangement (with .save) is is done so
       verbosely as a default (can be overridden)
   show_verbose : boolean
       logic if showing a cow.patch arangement (with .show) is is done so
       verbosely as a default (can be overridden)
   num_attempts : int
       Number of attempts to correct the global size of the arangment to
       allow the plotnine ggplot objects to have the expected sizes with
       desired aspect ratio. Minimum value is 1, which means no correction is
       made.
   base_height : float
       inches for the minimum height of a plotnine ggplot object if no global
       height of the arrangement is provided in the `.show()` and `.save()`
       functions.
   base_aspect_ratio : float
       ratio that (along with base_height) defines underlying minimum width
       of a plotnine ggplot object if no global width of the arrangement is
       provided in the `.show()` and `.save()` functions. This ratio is the
       golden ratio.
